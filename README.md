# beammp-mod-examples

Collection of BeamMP Mod examples pulled from the [BeamMP Discord](https://discord.gg/beammp) & the BeamNG [mods repository](https://www.beamng.com/resources/) for studying & learning on how to create mods for [BeamMP](https://beammp.com).

## Resources for writing BeamMP Mods

### BeamMPWiki

**Link**: https://wiki.beammp.com/

Useful for learning more about serverside scripting, and sending events between client and server.

### ClientSide Scripting

Unfortunately, the client mods documentation for BeamNG isn't great so you will have to either ask in the BeamMP discord, or consult lua source code.

In the [BeamMP repository](https://github.com/BeamMP/BeamMP) you will find a `lua` folder that you can consult for client mod functions.

You may also consult the official [Lua references](https://wiki.beamng.com/Lua_Reference-2.html)

Also check the new documentation for some input, e.g:

- Modding inputs: https://documentation.beamng.com/modding/input/actions/
