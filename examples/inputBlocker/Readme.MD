| **Type**        | Client                                                                                 |
| **Description** | Example of how to block client inputs (e.g. world editor & console, etc)               |

**Remarks:**

Regarding preventing respawn abuse:

> That is of course also possible, using this method. And since lua is great for it, you could even create timers that only allow resetting / respawning once every so often, or you could disallow resets while a race is in progress, etc

**Caveats:**

> Now, as far as detecting if a player has loose levels edits in their user data folder that could give them an advantage.... and then doing something about it to prevent them loading those edits... This may be possible, but gets a bit more involved.
